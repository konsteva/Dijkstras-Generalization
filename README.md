# Dijkstras-Generalization
A generalized version of Dijkstra's algorithm to find optimal path using metrics other than shortest path. It allows to find optimal paths using the metrics: Hop Count, Shortest Path and Widest Path (Bandwith) and builds the foundation to use other metrics as well. The methodology of the implementation is based on routing algebra.
